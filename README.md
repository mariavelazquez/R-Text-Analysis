Analysis of Disneyland Reviews

In this project, my aim is to thoroughly explore and analyze Disneyland reviews, uncovering valuable insights into visitor sentiments, preferences, and key themes across Disneyland California, Disneyland Hong Kong, and Disneyland Paris. By delving into a vast corpus of reviews, we seek to understand the unique experiences and perceptions of visitors. Through a journey of data exploration and refinement, we aim to extract actionable insights that provide a holistic view of the enchanting world of Disneyland.

This code is written in R programming language and is used to perform topic modeling on a set of reviews. The code uses the following R packages: tidytext, readr, dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, tm, topicmodels, keyATM, quanteda, forcats, and rmarkdown.
